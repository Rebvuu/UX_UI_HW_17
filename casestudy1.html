            <p>In this case study, we delve into the design of a skincare recommendation app. My team, Jacqueline Ongsip,
                Yin Jiayu and I spearheaded the design process. Our responsibilities encompassed executing comprehensive user research,
                creating wireframes, and rigorously testing the resulting prototypes.</p>

            <p>After conducting interviews, we discovered that users struggle to choose the appropriate skincare products for their routine. 
                This difficulty largely stems from a lack of understanding of the ingredients in these products. Additionally, they often have specific preferences or skin concerns they would like to target, 
                and a quick Google search isn't enough to accurately describe the product.</p>
